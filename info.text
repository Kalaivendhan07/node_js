Node.js is an open source server environment that uses JavaScript on server. A Node.js application runs within a single process, without generating a new thread for each request. Node.js includes asynchronous I/O primitives as a part of its standard library, which prevents JavaScript code from blocking and, in general, libraries in Node.js are developed using non-blocking paradigms. This makes blocking behaviour the exception instead of the rule.


It is developed by Ryan Dahi in the year 2009 and v22.4.1 is the latest version of Node.js. Because it is cross-platform one can easily run on Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS and more.
