Node.js is an open source server environment that uses JavaScript on server. A Node.js application runs within a single process, without generating a new thread for each request. Node.js includes asynchronous I/O primitives as a part of its standard library, which prevents JavaScript code from blocking and, in general, libraries in Node.js are developed using non-blocking paradigms. This makes blocking behaviour the exception instead of the rule.


It is developed by Ryan Dahi in the year 2009 and v22.4.1 is the latest version of Node.js. Because it is cross-platform one can easily run on Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS and more.



Why node js ?

Node.js is famous due to the use of JavaScript across the entire stack, asynchronous programming model for handling multiple requests simultaneously, fast execution due to the V8 engine, large and active community support, scalability for real-time applications, cross-platform compatibility, and its role in enabling full-stack development. All these features make Node.js very fast and popular.

Key Features of Node.js:
JavaScript Everywhere
Asynchronous Programming Model
Fast Execution
Large and Active Community
Scalability
Cross-Platform Compatibility




Node Js Basics:::

Key features of Node.js:

Non-blocking I/O: Node.js is asynchronous, enabling efficient handling of concurrent requests.
Event-driven architecture: Developers can create event-driven applications using callbacks and event emitters.
Extensive module ecosystem: npm (Node Package Manager) provides access to thousands of reusable packages.

Core Modules
Node.js includes several core modules for essential functionality. Some commonly used ones are:

fs (File System): Read/write files and directories.
http: Create HTTP servers and clients.
path: Manipulate file paths.
events: Implement custom event handling.

Datatypes in Node.js
Node.js contains various types of data types similar to JavaScript.

Boolean
Undefined
Null
String
Number
Loose Typing: Node.js supports loose typing, which means you donâ€™t need to specify what type of information will be stored in a variable in advance. We use the var and let keywords in Node.js declare any type of variable. Examples are given below: 

Common Use Cases:::
Building RESTful APIs
Real-time applications using WebSockets
Microservices architecture
Serverless functions with AWS Lambda

events module and events emitter class:::::

working with read line module::::::
=>process is a global object of node js
=>\n -->next line
=>readline having extends of events module


file module :::
//write file
//read file
//rename 
//update 
//delete


working with readable and writtable streams :::
In Node.js, streams are an essential concept for handling I/O operations efficiently. Streams can be readable, writable, or both. They provide a way to work with large data sets by processing data in chunks rather than loading it all into memory at once.

pipe and pipe chainning:::
The .pipe() method is a powerful feature in Node.js that allows you to connect readable streams to writable streams, making it easy to process data in chunks. This is particularly useful for tasks like file I/O, data compression, and network operations.

Pipe chaining allows you to connect multiple streams together, where the output of one stream becomes the input of the next. This is useful for processing data through multiple stages, such as reading from a file, compressing the data, and then writing it to another file.
