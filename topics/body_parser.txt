In Node.js, body-parser is a middleware used to parse the body of incoming HTTP requests. It extracts data from the body of the request and makes it available in req.body. This is especially useful for handling data sent through POST requests, such as form submissions or JSON payloads.

Here are the main methods offered by body-parser:

1.bodyParser.json()
2.bodyParser.urlencoded()
3.bodyParser.raw()
4.bodyParser.text()



1. bodyParser.json():::::::

This method parses incoming requests with JSON payloads. It uses the JSON parsing functionality built into JavaScript.

Usage: When the client sends JSON data in the request body.
Example Request Header: Content-Type: application/json
ex:{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 30
}


2. bodyParser.urlencoded():::::

This method parses incoming requests with URL-encoded payloads. It is typically used for parsing form submissions.

app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false }));

extended: false: Uses the querystring library to parse the data.
extended: true: Uses the qs library to parse the data, allowing for rich objects and arrays to be encoded into the URL-encoded format.

Example Request Header: Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Example Request Body: name=John+Doe&age=30

clear explanation about extended::
extended: true::::

req.body====>user[name]=John&user[age]=30&user[hobbies][]=reading&user[hobbies][]=travelling

With extended: true, the resulting req.body will be:
{
  user: {
    name: 'John',
    age: '30',
    hobbies: ['reading', 'travelling']
  }
}

extended: false::

Resulting req.body with extended: false
The resulting req.body would be:

{
  'user[name]': 'John',
  'user[age]': '30',
  'user[hobbies][]': ['reading', 'travelling']
}


3. bodyParser.raw():::::::
This method parses incoming requests into a Buffer. It is useful when you need to handle the raw binary data.

app.use(bodyParser.raw({ type: 'application/octet-stream' }));
Usage: When the client sends binary data.
Example Request Header: Content-Type: application/octet-stream
Example Request Body: Binary data


4. bodyParser.text()
This method parses incoming requests with text payloads. It is useful for parsing plain text data.

app.use(bodyParser.text());

Usage: When the client sends plain text data.
Example Request Header: Content-Type: text/plain
Example Request Body: Hello, World!
