Middleware in Node.js refers to functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the application's request-response cycle. Middleware functions can perform tasks such as modifying request and response objects, ending the request-response cycle, calling the next middleware function in the stack, or even terminating the cycle.

Middleware 1  →  (req, res, next) {
                 // Modify req or res
                 next();  // Pass control to next middleware
               }
     ↓
Middleware 2  →  (req, res, next) {
                 // Modify req or res
                 next();  // Pass control to next middleware
               }
     ↓
Middleware 3  →  (req, res, next) {
                 // Modify req or res
                 res.send('Response');  // End response cycle
               }
     ↓
End Response

Incoming Request: When a request is made to a Node.js server, it enters the middleware pipeline.
Middleware Functions: Each middleware function receives the req (request) and res (response) objects. It can modify these objects, perform tasks, and decide whether to pass control to the next middleware or end the request-response cycle.
next() Function: This function is used to pass control to the next middleware function. If next() is not called within a middleware function, the request-response cycle might end prematurely.
Ending the Response: Middleware functions can also end the response cycle by sending a response back to the client using res.send() or similar methods.


Middleware in Node.js, particularly when used with Express.js, can perform a variety of functions that enhance the application's request-response cycle. Here are some common functionalities of middleware:
